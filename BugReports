PhoneNumber:
    the first issue I encountered was when i started to cover edge cases for the Phone number
        phone number is not unique so  Customers can have a phone number that is shared between them in the crm system 
    if the phone number becomes unique it can provide another way to find the customer and no more customers can have the 
        same phone number 


BankAccountNumber:
    same as phoneNumber this field can also be unique 
        MultiÃÅple Customers can have the same  BankAccountNumber wich can lead to serious issue of having many Customers with 1 BankAccountNumber
    same as phoneNumber it can be unique to provide another way to find the customer and to make sure that no other customers have the same BankAccountNumber


Firstname, Lastname, DateOfBirth uniqueness issue:
    imagine we have 2 customers with identical Firstname, Lastname, DateOfBirth that want to be created in the system, as the mentioned fields are set to be unique 
        one customer can't be registered in the system and we lose a customer in the process wich if the uniqueness of these fields were to be removed this problem would 
        be resolved and based on the mentioned issues above we can locate the customer by other fields.
